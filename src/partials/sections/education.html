                    This last year of the Epitech curriculum helps students
                    to be ready for the hiring market, by teaching them how 
                    to negotiate a salary or learn some new and modern
                    technologies for example.

                    During the year, you also show-off your end of studies
                    project!

                    As part of the Epitech curriculum, students have to start their
                    master in a foreign country. I decided to go to Québec,
                    Canada, to enjoy the weather and the beautiful landscapes!

                    Winter was long and snowy as I expected, and I loved it!
                    New relationships and really great memories.

                    Epitech is the first school I attended after graduating
                    high school. As I was already a programming passionate,
                    that was the best choice I could think of, and I really
                    enjoyed these three years.
